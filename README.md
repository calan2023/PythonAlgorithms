# Python Algorithms
Project contains source code for sorting algorithms (selection, bubble, insertion, shell, merge, quick, counting) and for searching algorithms (linear (unordered and ordered), binary, hashing).
Also contains a program, sort_and_search.py, that applies these algorithms on a list created by the user.
